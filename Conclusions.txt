While this data analysis doesn't take into account many underlying factors, several takeaways can be made from the resulting graph
comparing passing performances throughout the NFL season between indoor stadiums and outdoor stadiums with poor weather. First of all,
indoor stadiums obviously overall reflect better performance, which can be easily assumed and accepted.

Possibly more interesting is how both indoor and bad weather stadiums declined as the year went on. While I cannot assume the main
cause of the decline, there may be factors other than weather such as defensive players improving as more film comes out to study,
or if offensive players deal with more injuries. Whatever the reason is, the decline cannot be attributed all to weather.

While both performances dipped throughout the year, indoor stadiums experienced a much smoother decline compared to the unpredictable behavior
of bad weather stadiums. Notice how week 6 to 7 drops by about 0.3 standardized units with no apparent explanation. To be frank, there
may be no real solution. At the beginning of this analysis, I predicted that bad weather stadiums would be impacted negatively late
in the year due to the cold weather. However, what I have come to realize after visualizing the data is that the weather doesn't
necessarily reduce performance later in the year. Instead, it seems to make predicting every week to week performance a challenge,
shown by the relatively smooth indoor stadium data compared to the jagged lines of the bad weather stadiums, which seems difficult
to achieve with such a large data set of 16 years of NFL games. Ultimately, weather that can change from day to day will create
an inherent unpredictability around the passing performance in the NFL from week to week, no matter where in the schedule they are.
